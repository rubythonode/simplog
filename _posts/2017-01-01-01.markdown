This post will be helpful for you to write post using all Simplog's elements.


### Highlight Code View

You can use highlight code view.

```html
<article id="simplog">
  <h1>Simplog</h1>
  <p>
    "Simplog" is a compound word of "Simple" and "Blog".
  </p>
</article>
```


### Headings

You can use 3 heading by default.

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Heading Level 1</h3>
<h4 style="margin: 0;">Heading Level 2</h4>
<h5 style="margin: 0 0 50px;">Heading Level 3</h5>

```markdown
### Heading Level 1
#### Heading Level 2
##### Heading Level 3
```

`# Heading` is for blog's logo and `## Heading` is for post's title.
So it is recommended that you would not use those two headings in the post.


### Paragraph

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
