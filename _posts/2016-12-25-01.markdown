You can set your website information by fixing `_config.yml` file.


### Website title & description

You can set your website title and description by editting `title` and `description` attribute.

```xml
title: Simplog
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Write the description of your website.
```

Don't erase `> # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"`.


### Base URL

You can set your website path by editting `baseurl` attribute.

```xml
baseurl: "/"
```

Or if you want to use subpath,

```xml
baseurl: "/subpath"
```


### Email for contact

`email` attribute is used for contact page.
Just write your email address.

```xml
email: "example@domain.com"
```


### Social Information

In the bottom of the website, you'll see social icon linked to your social page.
All you need to do is write your social page's web address.

```xml
facebook: ""
instagram: ""
twitter: ""
github: ""
```
