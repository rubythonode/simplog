You can set your website information by fixing `_config.yml` file.


### Website title

You can set your website title by editting `title` attribute.

```xml
title: Simplog
```


### Base URL

You can fix your website path by editting `baseurl` attribute.

```xml
baseurl: "/"
```

Or if you want to use subpath,

```xml
baseurl: "/subpath"
```
